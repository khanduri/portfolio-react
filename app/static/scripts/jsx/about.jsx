              <p>Hi there! I'm Prashant Khanduri</p>
              <p>I'm originally from India. Although most of my school days were spent in India (New Delhi), a few of them slipped into Nepal (Kathmandu), Canada (Waterloo) and United States (Los Angeles)</p>
              <p>On a day to day basis, I tell computers what to do and they seem to obey me (for the most part). I end up getting paid for <a href='#' ng-click="scroll('#experience')">some of it</a>, the other portion ends up on a <a href="https://github.com/khanduri/">public domain</a></p>
              <p>I also <a href="http://khanduri.github.io/">blog</a>, but I haven't really scoped out the topics I'd like to talk about. For now, I'm just using it to collect ideas that I find interesting. I hope someday a pattern will emerge</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>In case you're wondering, the above picture is me trying to slide down Mt Rainier (Paradise snowplay area) and not doing a great job at it. I like the picture though</p>
              <p>You know a lot about me now! .. <a href='#' ng-click="scroll('#contact')">Ok your turn</a></p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </section>
